# BetterDiscord-Plugins-and-Themes
Unofficial Plugins and Themes for [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp)

This is a collection of plugins 'n themes. I'll try to keep them as up-to-date as possible.

Please note that not every single plugin/theme is by me. If i took your plugin/theme and you want to be credited somewhere here as author just tell me.

Everything goes to ``` %appdata%\BetterDiscord\ ```

##__How to get a better Discord experience__:

`1.` If you don't have it, get **Discord** from https://discordapp.com/apps

`2.` Download **BetterDiscord** for your platform on https://betterdiscord.net/home

`3.` Get **BetterDiscord+** from https://github.com/Bluscream/BetterDiscord/releases/download/3/BetterDiscord.Setup.exe

Or get the plugins you want manually from https://github.com/Bluscream/BetterDiscord-Plugins-and-Themes/tree/master/plugins or https://github.com/Bluscream/BetterDiscord/archive/master.zip

`4.` If you used the installer continue with step `5.` Otherwise place the plugins you want in `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\plugins\`.

`5.` Refresh Discord with `[CTRL]` + `[SHIFT]` + `[R]` or just restart Discord completely.

`6.` Go to the **BetterDiscord** `settings` -> `plugins` tab and check all plugins you want.

`6.1` Please note that `BetterAPI Plugin` and `BetterDiscordWebsock` are requirements for some plugins so you should have them always enabled.
